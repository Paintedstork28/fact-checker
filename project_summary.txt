PROJECT SUMMARY: Fact Checker — Multi-Agent Verification Tool
=============================================================

1. PROJECT CONCEPT
   A multi-agent fact-checking tool where 4 adversarial AI agents rigorously verify
   user-submitted claims. Each agent has a distinct personality: Researcher (gathers info),
   Skeptic (audits sources), Adversary (argues against), and Judge (delivers verdict).
   Target audience: anyone wanting to verify news, claims, or statements.

2. HOW IT WAS BUILT
   - Frontend: Streamlit (chat-style UI with progress indicators)
   - LLM: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via google-genai SDK
   - Search: DuckDuckGo via duckduckgo-search Python library
   - Architecture: 4-agent pipeline with retry loop (Skeptic can send Researcher back)
   - Each agent has a unique system prompt and structured JSON output format

3. DATABASE STRUCTURE
   No database. All processing is in-memory per session.

4. DATA SOURCES
   - DuckDuckGo search results (real-time web search)
   - URL content fetching (extracts text from web pages)

5. APIS & COSTS
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash API — free (generous free tier)
   - DuckDuckGo Search — free, no API key needed
   - Total cost: $0

6. DATA REFRESH
   Real-time. Every claim triggers fresh web searches and LLM analysis.

7. DEPLOYMENT
   - Local: streamlit run app.py
   - Production: Streamlit Cloud (connected to GitHub repo)

8. WHAT IT CAN BE USED FOR
   - Verify news headlines and viral claims
   - Check political statements and statistics
   - Research factual accuracy of articles
   - Educational tool for understanding source credibility

9. SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS
   - Add claim history/bookmarking
   - Export fact-check reports as PDF
   - Add more source tiers and domain lists
   - Implement caching for repeated claims
   - Add support for image/video claim verification
   - User feedback mechanism on verdict accuracy
